# Module 1 Challenge
Columbia Data Analysis Bootcamp - Due 20Jun2021


## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to utilize excel in an effort to analyze the outcomes of kickstarter funding campaigns. In particular, the correlation between the launch month and outcome for theater endeavors, as well as whether fundraising goals were a factor in the success or failure of a proposed play. 

## Analysis and Challenges

In order to preform the analysis, I first calculated the launch year and month from the source data, and from there, created a pivot table to demonstrate a summary of the outcomes of theater campaigns, whether it be success or failure, for each month. From the table, I then created a line graph, to depict the relationship between success or failure and each particular month. Regarding the relationship between the fundraising goals, and the outcome of the outcome of a potential play, I first created a query, which allowed me create a custom formula to label the appropriate fundraising limits, and then grouped the data by aforementioned categories. Following this, I migrated the data into a table, and then found the total for each of the outcomes, the number of plays as well as the respective percentages. 

In regards to challenges I faced, the first that comes to mind is the grouping of the query. I am certain there is a way to lay out the columns automatically, whether it be transposing or another built in method, though I was unable format the data innately within the quey. Had I been able to do so, I would have the summations and percentages into the query, which would have been far more efficient as copying over the information into a second table and preforming the calculations there.
